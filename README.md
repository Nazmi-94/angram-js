"Complexity of the solution"
The complexity of the algorithm is O(n) where n is equal to the dictionary length;

I find that the complexity O(n) is acceptable in this case, since we need to check every word in our dictionary with the word that is given.

Instruction

1/ First download the repository 

2/ open the comand line and change the path to the folder you have downloaded

3/ the 3rd party package i have used is nodejs. you need to download nodejs 

4/ if your dictionary has a different path then you need to change it but i have also pushed the dictionary in the folder

5/ type in node index.js 

6/ you will asked for the word you want. you will get all the anagram from the dictionary
