"Complexity of the solution"

The complexity of the algorithm is O(n) where n is equal to the dictionary length;

I find that the complexity O(n) is acceptable in this case, since we need to check every word in our dictionary with the word that is given.

Instruction

1/ The package i have used is nodejs. If you haven't installed nodejs, you need to download and install nodejs 

2/ Download the repository 

3/ The dictionary is already attached in the folder but if your dictionary has a different path, then you need to change the path in index.js

4/ Open the comand line and change the direction to the folder you have downloaded

5/ Type in the command-line: node index.js 

6/ You will be asked for the word you want to check. You will get all the anagram from the dictionary.
